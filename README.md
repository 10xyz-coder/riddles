  You have 3 `7`s, and you are to make 5 with them. You have to use ALL 3, and NO OTHER number. For eg. `3! - 3/3 = 5`. The Operations available to you are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, rooting, factorisation (!) and basic functions (sin, cos, tan, ceil, floor, round)
  </summary>


```
=> ceil(√7)! - 7/7
=> ciel(√7)! - 1
=> ciel(2.64)! - 1
=> 3! - 1
-> 6 - 1
=> 5
```
There are also other ways, such as
```
=> floor(√7)² + 7/7
=> floor(√7)² + 1
=> floor(2.64)² + 1
=> 2² + 1
=> 4 + 1
=> 5
```
