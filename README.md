  You have 3 `7`s, and you are to make 5 with them. You have to use ALL 3, and NO OTHER number. For eg. `3! - 3/3 = 5`. The Operations available to you are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, rooting, factorisation (!) and basic functions (sin, cos, tan, ceil, floor, round)

=> ciel(√ 7)! - 1
=> ciel(2.64)! - 1
=> 3! - 1
-> 6 - 1
=> 5
```
